#summary Build instructions.

= Build from source =

1. You need the `repo` script used by Google's Android. Then create a directory for example `zkgrails`.

`$ mkdir zkgrails`
`$ cd zkgrails`

2. You then can init the ZKGrails repository locally into your machine using the following command.

`$ repo init -u git@github.com:zkgrails/manifest.git`

3. Synchronize your repository.

`$ repo sync`

4. You may find `build.sh` script into your directory. Call it and it builds ZKGrails and other related projects.

`$ build.sh 5.0.6 1.1-M1`
