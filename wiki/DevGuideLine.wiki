= Tools =

We use:
  * GIT
  * GIT-SVN
  * Stacked GIT
for version control.

= Branches =

There are two important branches in the ZKGrails git repository. 

  * The first one is *master*, which is always kept stable.
  * The second one is *snapshot*, which more or less the development branch. Code in this branch can be very unstable.

You will always be working on the *snapshot* branch for fixing bugs and implementing features.

After getting a bug fixed or a feature implemented, please inform the team via the issue tracker. After that, if the issue is verified, its commits will be merged into the *master* branch.
