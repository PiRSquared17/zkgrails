for version control.


= Branches =

There are two important branches in the ZKGrails git repository. 

  * The first one is *master*, which is always kept stable.
  * The second one is *snapshot*, which more or less the development branch. Code in this branch can be very unstable.

You will always be working on the *snapshot* branch for fixing bugs and implementing features.

After getting a bug fixed or a feature implemented, please inform the team via the issue tracker. After that, if the issue is verified, its commits will be merged into the *master* branch.

We apply the same convention for stable series. When a new series is decided to have its own branch, we create 2 branches, *master-series*, and *snapshot-series*, for it.
We have *master-0.7.x* as a master branch of the series, say *0.7.x*. To fix bugs or implement new features into the series, please push your codes into *snapshot-0.7.x*. After issues are verified, its commits will be merged into the master branch of that series (in this example *master-0.7.x*).
